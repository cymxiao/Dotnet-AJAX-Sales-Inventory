**Timeline**

Working with Dotnet Core is proving to be somewhat cumbersome.  Got a couple of roles going on, but not yet totally hashed out.

If you'd like to initialized the admin navigate to
```
localhost:XXXX/Account/Setup
```
Then you can log in as admin@admin.admin with password '#T3stT3st' and have access to `localhost:XXXX/Roles` where you can see all of the roles that currently exist.

As a logged in normal user, you can navigate to `localhost:XXXX/Account/Upgrade` and add a new role to your account: ***MegaUser*** which in the future will be amazing and totally worth it.

There are no *timelines* yet per se.... but SOON.  Soon there will be much added functionality.  After I sleep more, of course.
